LMS
===

New **Next** and **Previous** buttons allow learners to navigate more
intuitively through courses.

A post listing view that shows not only post titles, but also the first line of
each post, is now available on the **Discussions** and **Teams** pages and in
inline discussions.

The **Progress** page loads significantly faster.

For course problems, the **Check** and **Final Check** buttons are now combined
in one **Submit** button, and less frequently used actions (such as **Save**
and **Show Answer**) have been moved to the side. 

Learners can quickly see whether problems are graded or ungraded.

Improvements to the discussions UI: added learner profile pictures to
discussion posts, a new header area, a more intuitive topic list, and an
enhanced UI that indicates unread posts, comments, and responses. You can also
now sort discussions by votes

Studio & Course Author Tools
============================

Course teams can easily copy and move HTML components in Studio. 

For rescoring, course teams can now specify that the system will only update a
learner's score if the process improves the learner's score. For more
information, see :ref:`opencoursestaff:rescore`.

CAPA problems now allow HTML formatting. See the following documentation for
more information about specific functionality:

* :ref:`opencoursestaff:Multiple Responses in Numerical Input Problems` for
  numerical input problems.

* :ref:`opencoursestaff:Using the Script Element in Multiple Choice Problems`
  for multiple choice problems.

* :ref:`opencoursestaff:Add Page`.

In open response assessment (ORA) problems, course teams can override the
grades from peer assessments. For more information, see
:ref:`opencoursestaff:Override a learner assessment grade`.

Improvements to the word cloud tool include a new Instructions field and
accessibility updates.

The ability to prevent learners from receiving feedback until they've dropped
all draggable items.

Added "View this course as" capability.

In the Student Profile report, added two columns: "enrollment mode" and
"verification status".

Last Week" metric.

In keeping with edX's commitment to creating accessible content for everyone,
everywhere, the Open edX Ficus release contains numerous accessibility
enhancements and improvements to readability and navigability.

Improved video player controls make downloading videos, transcripts, and
handouts easier.

For learners who use screen readers or keyboards only, core CAPA problem types,
including checkbox and text input problems, have been updated to make
identifying and responding to these problems easier.

Navigating among questions and reviewing survey results easier in the survey
tool is now easier.

The contrast has been increased on the sign-in page for Open edX sites.

In Insights, the <title> element on learner pages now indicates the correct
view when you switch between learner roster view and learner view.

Reorganized the HTML structure of the Progress page to be more accessible.

The course Home page now uses heading levels 1-5 in a way that screen readers
can more easily process.

For custom JavaScript problems, the jsinput tag includes a title attribute that
helps orient non-visual learners.

The video playback and volume sliders are now visible when learners view videos
in high contrast mode.

Made the visual chart on the Progress page more accessible to learners who use
keyboards and screen readers.



*******************************
System Upgrades and Updates
*******************************

Administrators can now configure third party authentication differently for
each of their sites. 

With Ficus, the operating system for the Open edX platform changes from Ubuntu
12.04 to Ubuntu 16.04, the latest long-term support (LTS) version of Ubuntu.
Ubuntu 12.04 reaches its end of life in April of this year. Unfortunately,
upgrading Open edX from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubunbu 16.04 is not possible. If your
existing installation of Open edX is based on Ubuntu 12.04, we recommend that
you build a new system.
